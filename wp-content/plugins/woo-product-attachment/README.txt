== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

e.g.

1. Upload `woo-product-attachment` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I upload multiple attachments for a single product using the Product Attachment for WooCommerce plugin? =

Absolutely! The Product Attachment for WooCommerce plugin allows you to add numerous attachments to your products. These can include images, documents, videos, and more, enriching your product pages with a variety of content.

= How can I display a downloadable attachment link on the product details and on the order completion page? =

To display downloadable attachments on your product details page and after an order is completed, simply enable the option "Show on Product page" and set the order status to "Completed" within the plugin settings. This will make the attachments visible on the respective product page and to customers upon order completion.

= What is the process for setting a downloadable attachment link to be available based on the order status? =

The WooCommerce Product Attachment plugin allows you to display downloadable links according to different order statuses. You can configure it to work with various statuses such as Pending Payment, Processing, On Hold, Completed, Cancelled, Refunded, or Failed. Once the customer‚Äôs order matches the status you‚Äôve selected, the download will be automatically available.

= How can I set an expiry date for a downloadable product attachment? =

With the plugin, you can set expiration dates for your product attachments. Enable the "Set date expires" feature, and specify the expiry date for the attachment. After this date passes, new orders will no longer have access to the attachments for download.

= Are there any limitations to the types of files I can attach to products? =

The WooCommerce Product Attachment plugin supports unlimited attachments in a wide array of formats, offering great flexibility for providing detailed product information.

= Can I customize how attachments are displayed to the customers? =

Yes, you have full control over the presentation of attachments. You can tailor the display according to your website‚Äôs styling and customer preferences for a seamless shopping experience.

= Is it possible to track which attachments are being downloaded the most? =

While the plugin focuses on the attachment of files, it does not inherently track the download frequency. However, you can use additional analytics tools to monitor download trends for your attachments.

= How can I provide attachments in multiple languages? =

You can upload separate attachments for each language if you're using a multilingual setup. Ensure that each file is associated with the correct language for an optimized international shopping experience.

= Can attachments still be accessed by customers who made a purchase before the attachment was added? =

Typically, attachments are accessed based on the state of the order at the time of purchase. However, you can update past orders to include new attachments manually if required.
